    <div class = "Motorcycles">
      <p> 
        I enjoy motorcycling, even though I don't have a bike. I find the idea of riding a motorcycle to be exhilarating and freeing.
        I hope to own a motorcycle in the future, at this point I don't have a dream bike but I love the look of <strong>naked bikes and dual sports</strong>.

    <div class = "Music">
      <p> 
        I have a passion for music and enjoy listening to a wide variety of genres but mainly krnb.
        You can always find me with my sony xm4s around my neck or in my ears. 
        If I had to name 3 artists that I could listen to for the rest of my life, it would be:

        <ul>
          <li>DPR IAN</li>
          <li>Epik High</li> 
          <li>oceanfromtheblue</li> 
        </ul>

    <div class = "Skateboarding">
      <p> 
        I've only recently started skateboarding and I'm still learning the basics.
        My friends are the main reasons I'm still skating since they also do computer science and enjoy skating around.
        We skate together twice a week at skateparks near campus.
